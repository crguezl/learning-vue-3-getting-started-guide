# Annotated Reading of the **Essentials** Section of the *Vue.js version 3 Guide*

These are my notes written in pandoc markdown [@casiano] from reading the guide of Vue.js (v3) [@vuestart3],   and other [references](#references).

This document only covers
the initial sections of the *Essentials* part of the Guide, from section *Introduction* up to section *Computed Properties and Watchers*.  

These notes have been ellaborated using [pandoc](https://pandpc.org) to translate it the markdown to HTML.

At the current time (December 2021), this notes are experimental, since the HTML generated by pandoc has some incompatibilities with Vue and I had to resort to some awful tricks to made them work.


1. I'm using the [pandoc-include](https://github.com/DCsunset/pandoc-include) filter
2. The citation styles have been taken from [@citationstyles].
3. The HTML generation is reached using [@pandoc-toc-sidebar],
   a Pandoc HTML template that  has a navbar on the top of the page for website navigation, and a TOC (table of contents) on the sidebar for page navigation. The `../mathjax` file and the option `--include-in-header=../mathjax` have been added  in this version to include mathjax so we can include  formulas like  $x^2_3 = \sqrt{x^2+1}$


To see the result, you can 

1. Open the deployment in the  GitHub pages <https://crguezl.github.io/learning-vue-geting-started-guide/> of the repo [crguezl/learning-vue-geting-started-guide](https://github.com/crguezl/learning-vue-geting-started-guide) containing the notes or
2. To install it locally, fork the repo. You have to have `pandoc` installed and  then
   1. Run `npm install-pandoc-dependencies` to install `pandoc-include` 
   2. Run `npm start` to compile the sources and open the resulting `index.html` file.
